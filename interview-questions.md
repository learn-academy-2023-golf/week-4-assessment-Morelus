# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the virtual DOM in React?

Your answer: It compares the changes and refreshes the changed elements. The UI of the changes or the site we can see. 

Researched answer:
 It provides a mechanism that allows the actual DOM to compute minimal DOM operations when re-rendering the UI. For example, when an element in the real DOM is changed, the DOM will re-render the element and all of its children.
2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It means that it returns the last line of code without needing to tell it. 

Researched answer:
In Ruby, the concept of "implicit return" refers to the automatic or implied return value of a method or block. It means that in Ruby, the last evaluated expression within a method or block is automatically returned as the result of that method or block, without the need to use the return keyword explicitly.



3. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Your answer: Both are read line by line. Ruby is simpler to use with syntax and less work to execute the actions. JS uses === and Ruby uses ==. Ruby uses snake_casing. Js uses camelCasing.

Researched answer:

Both languages support functional programming paradigms. They allow functions to be first-class citizens, enabling features like higher-order functions, closures, and functional programming concepts.

JavaScript (with Node.js) and Ruby come with extensive standard libraries. They offer a wide range of built-in functions and modules that simplify various tasks, such as string manipulation, file handling, and network communication.

JavaScript is an object-oriented front-end scripting language and it can be utilized in the back-end process with the help of the Node. js framework. 

Ruby is also an object-oriented language a priori, but it is a general programming language.

One big difference between Ruby and JavaScript is the falsey-ness of certain values. Like in Ruby, null (in Ruby, it’s nil) and false will return false, however, some truthful values in Ruby will return false in JavaScript, like 0, empty strings (“”), and undefined.


4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: git

Researched answer:
RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Ruby blocks: A Ruby block is an anonymous function that is passed to a method to determine the outcome.

2. RSpec: RSpec (Ruby specification) is a domaine specific language used for testing the behavior of objects in the Ruby programming language. Developers can use RSpec to create specifications or specs that describe the desired output.

3. Test-driven development:
Test driven development and behavior driven development are very similar. The difference is the scope of focus. In test driven development, the goal is checking the input and output of the code. In behavior driven development, the tests assure the code will behave for the user as expected.
